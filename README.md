# Reading Experience Ontology (REO)


"READ-IT (Reading Europe Advanced Data Investigation Tool) is a 3-years (2018-2020) transnational, interdisciplinary R&D project funded by the Joint Programming Initiative for Cultural Heritage that will build a unique large-scale, user-friendly, open access, semantically-enriched investigation tool to identify and share groundbreaking evidence about 18th-21st century Cultural Heritage of reading in Europe", source [READ-IT Project Website](https://readit-project.eu/). 

The Reading Experience Ontology is one of the outcome of READ-IT project. More about the methodology and requirements of REO can be found in this [paper](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/understanding-phenomenology-reading-through-modelling-0) (under review).

This repository includes two versions of REO:

- V1.x, this version is a minimal, stand-alone ontology representing the consensus reached by the project on a set of key concepts and relations necessary for the study of reading experiences.
- V2.x, this version extends V1.x including concepts not currently used and/or under evaluation. 

The latest version of REO is the V1.8. With this version we rolled back from the initial hypothesis of alignments with CIDOC-CRM to a stand-alone version.

## READ-IT
The JPI READ-IT (Reading Europe Advanced Data Investigation Tools) is an interdisciplinary project aiming to advance the study of reading in both understanding of the phenomenon and methods. READ-IT brings together researchers from different disciplines and case studies on different countries, languages, periods and social groups with the goals of:  

- Designing, developing and validating a common digital toolbox, able to support the interoperability2 of research data 

- Addressing broad research questions requiring both a large-scale data collection and a broad view on the European continent geographical and temporal landscape.

Behind these goals, there are two major hidden methodological assumptions: 

1. a large-scale data collection cannot be done within a consistent research framework, in terms of either a large-scale use case and disciplinary methodologies and theories 

2. reading is a multi-facets phenomenon and therefore its understanding requires a bridging the different components and perspectives, object and focus of the different disciplines involved.  

In this view, REO provides the common conceptual infrastructure necessary to enable (through READ-IT toolbox) the interoperability between research case studies.
